# Q3 Fixing the error-prone codes.
# Below is the code (left) that is encrypted using a number. Once you decrypt the below code, it reveals the original code with many errors. Please fix them and explain them using comments (#).

# the Encrypter (this Encrypter is also the decrypter)
"""
this is due to the encrypter cycling through by a set number.
for example if 'A' is to equal 'Z' we can add 26 or sub 1 from the ord.

to find the key we can simply cycile through the encrypter using a 'for loop'
by doing so we found that the key is 13.
as loop 13 (key:13) showed "tybony_inevnoyr" -> "global_variable" (Code commented out below)

then I striped each line from one .txt file decrypted it and placed it in a new .txt file (Code commented out below)
